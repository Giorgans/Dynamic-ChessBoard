# Dynamic-ChessBoard
* Due to some testing, the app covers all the necessary requirements of the assesment 
* Focused more on the app functionallity and less on how fancy the moves look.
* Would prefer to use protocols-delegates instead of some global vars (to transfer data back and forth) I used , and the code in better order and cleaner
* The cell that the knight is moving is highlighted on orange color and the ending point with green color
* The knight does not move. It is always on the starting position. The app will show the path after clicking check 
* Build and run on XCode 14.3, iOS 16.4 (iPhone 14 Pro) , macOS Ventura 13.3.1 (Intel)
