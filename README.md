# Dynamic-ChessBoard
-Due to some testing the app covers all of the necessary requirements of the assesment 
-Focused more on the app functionallity and less for how fancy the moves look.
-Would prefer to use protocols-delegates instead of some global vars I used and the code in better order and clean
-The cell that the knight is moving is highlighted on orange color and the ending point with green color
